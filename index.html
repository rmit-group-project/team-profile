									<h3>IT project</h3>
									<p>IT Project
Overview

A simplified and less expensive home automation system that is capable of controlling lights, heaters, tv, radios etc by touch, sounds or eye and body motion's for people with disabilities and anybody who desires a simple solution. Today these things are available but are very expensive and require specialists trades like electricians and builders to install or electronic whizzes to build. Other devices like Google home or Amazon Alexa can be used but won't connect to or operate all devices and settings correctly requiring multiple different home automation systems. My project will be an electronic device operated by a native unit or mobile phone and computer application using eye and body motion, sound or touch to control which can operate all these devices and their functions and using the power of AI to improve the user experience.
Motivation

I've worked with people who have disabilities for over a decade now and i believe there is a long way to go in bringing home automation to people with a disability in an inexpensive and easy to operate way. I have seen the difficulties caused by this to people with disabilities and their families who cannot afford the expensive home systems or don't have the technical knowledge to operate and add devices and functions to current less expensive units. This would improve the quality of life and bring more independence to those with a disability and their families by creating a simplified way for people to operate their own electronic devices.
Description

I think almost everybody would know of somebody whether it be a family member, friend or colleague who at some point has had problems that result in loss of mobility and being restricted to very limited physical abilities where the simplest of life's pleasure that we often take for granted are no longer a simple exercise like turning lights on/off and adjusting the temperature in your room or using a smart tv to stream a movie. Currently some of these things can be done with relative ease to some people and not others, a person with the inability to speak cannot use a voice control system but could possibly use a touch screen or motion tracking tool to track arm or eye motion and a person who is unable to use their limbs could use voice control and so on and over time these situations can change resulting in the need for different systems to aid in independence for these people. Currently, the devices out there aren't able to fulfill this problem completely, most only do one side of the job. So by using a large enough touch screen display adapted with a camera sensitive enough to track pupil movement, motion sensors to track body movement and microphone and speakers for 2 way communication with the device. This would allow a control unit that almost everybody could operate and by adding a Wifi and IR systems to it a person can clone remote controls, turn on lights etc with any of the above methods. Giving greater independence and choice to people who have a limited quality of life. All up this device would be relatively cheap compared to other home automation systems and voice-controlled smart units. By implementing AI technologies to this device the user experience would become far easier and enjoyable. The potential of what could be added to the list of possible uses for a device are endless, emergency device, rehabilitation education, and gaming etc.
Tools and Technologies
Hardware

    Raspberry Pi 3 Model B - Linux Pimoroni Speaker pHAT for Raspberry Pi Zero for audio such as device responses or alerts/alarms ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array for Raspberry Pi for voice control Raspberry Pi 7" LCD touch screen or bigger for touch control and user experience 1080p HD Camera Module Board 5mp Fish Eye IR Night Vision for Raspberry Pi or more powerful webcam if needed for motion and eye tracking Motion-tracking sensors 

Software

Link >>> Eye Tracking software from pygaze.com
Link >>> Voice Control software from jasperproject
Link >>> PubNub motion control software.
Programming Languages
Understanding of Python, Java and C languages for the programmes and the user UX and UI

Skills required

This project would require a mix of building with a Raspberry Pi unit and sensors and possibly a bit more of an advanced knowledge of programming in languages such as Python, Java or C language to programme each of the units and to make sure they a function correctly. Also, experience with building Raspberry Pi would be essential as this is what the unit is mostly comprised of. As well as having its own native unit this system could run on Android and IOS devices so understanding of application making for these device's The ability to use Raspbian operating system on the Pi to run the desired programmes A basic understanding of how electronics work would also be desired to prevent any possible injury.
Outcome

The desired outcome for this device is to have the ability to simply control all units that can be controlled by Wifi or Infrared by a Raspberry Pi module that can be operated through motion tracking, touchscreen, sound or eye tracking. This device would be used by anybody and would be especially useful to those with degenerative disabilities. Without the need for any complex programming or wiring issues and with a simple user-friendly interface that has the ability to learn routine's and automatically add new devices and their functionality by AI.
