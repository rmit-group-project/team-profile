									<h2>Dave Bradbury</h2>
									<p>Hi! My name's Dave. I live on the Central Coast of NSW and am of English background. I have a Certifcate 3 in Audio Engineering however this is my first time at university. I currently work in the Audio Visual/ Home Automation industry in which I have been working in for about 15 years. I am interested in changing vocation and hope to get a job in the IT industry. My hobbies include playing guitar and cooking, however, I don’t get too much time for guitar anymore as much of my time is spent looking after my 1 year old son.
									I am looking forward to learning about the vast aspects of information technology and am interested in developing skills that I normally wouldn't have tried to learn off my own accord through this degree (for example building web pages). As I work part time currently and look after my son I have limited time during the day, this led me to online study through Open Univeristies and RMIT due to the fact that I can do the work during the time I have available.
									I hope you enjoy the site! </p>

									<h2>Ben Stephenson</h2>
									<p>I have spent most of my life living in rural areas, with a few years in cities in between. I have a 2 year old daughter and what little free time she affords me I like to spend fishing and camping.Before working in IT I did short stints as a (un)registered surveyor, a relief milker, worked in a sawmill, conducted road condition audits and worked in the mincing room of a knackery. That last job made me appreciate the value of a clean, airconditioned office. </p>

									<h2>Darren aka dplayerzz</h2>
									<p>My name is Darren Borkett and I am Australian who has lived on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland for most of my adult life and I grew up in Vietnam prior to that. At present, I am employed as a cleaner which I have been doing for about four years. I also have a passion for music and play a few musical instruments, mainly piano, violin and guitar in a range of musical styles. I also like to learn new things and completed a Bachelor of Accounting in 2011.  Currently, I am working towards graded exams in both piano and violin. I first became interested in the field of Information Technology when I experimented with different programming languages, such as Visual Basic and Python, but just never committed to fully studying them. I grew up using computers like most of my generation and so am confident with navigating Windows. I am new to IT and have no experience in the industry but am keen to learn through the university degree online that I am currently doing.  I am especially programming, app development and diagnosing computer problems.  </p>

									<h2>Group project</h2>
									<p> A simplified and less expensive home automation system that is capable of controlling lights, heaters, tv, radios etc by touch, sounds or eye and body motion's for people with disabilities and anybody who desires a simple solution. Today these things are available but are very expensive and require specialists trades like electricians and builders to install or electronic whizzes to build. Other devices like Google home or Amazon Alexa can be used but won't connect to or operate all devices and settings correctly requiring multiple different home automation systems. My project will be an electronic device operated by a native unit or mobile phone and computer application using eye and body motion, sound or touch to control which can operate all these devices and their functions and using the power of AI to improve the user experience. </p>
